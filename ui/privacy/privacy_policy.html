        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>The Expense Tracking app does not implement logging in, 
            so all expenses added to the service are shared among all users. 
            However, no personal information is stored inside these expenses. 
            This page will be updated as soon as more functionality is incorporated in the app.
